A small input method like (not yet a real one) piece for entering LaTeX code with an unsuitable keyboard (e.g. finnish)
# Background
Having been writing a lot of mathematics back in the days, on computers using a swedish/finnish keyboard i bumped into a annoying problem (this is really resurrection of work from the past; 1997!)  Curly braces and the backslash are not in the everyday use places which are taken by the umlaut letters and such.  The cursable alg-gr key is needed to get the all important characters, and this makes fluent typing quite impossible, at least in my experience.  This was my solution back then.

And I still use it today!

Actual code will be pushed someday soon...
